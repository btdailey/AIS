SIFT/SURF:

	Find Keypoints in images: Based on Intensity?
	Calculates number of matches

RANSAC: RAndom Sample Consensus
	
	Finds homography between samples
		Homography?? Set of directions to convert one image to another?
		Basically a shift to make one set of keypoints line up

	Does many sets to find best homography that has most inliers (number of points that line up)

	Can use this to off set corrections and get Lat and Lon?
